{"title": "UEFA Champions League Final", "article": "Before the Final:\r<br><br> The UEFA Champions League Final, the most prestigious tournament in European football, will take place in London on June 1st. The teams who will be facing off are Real Madrid of Spain and Borussia Dortmund of Germany. Madrid narrowly beat Bayern Munchen in the semifinals 4-3 on aggregate. Dortmund beat Paris Saint Germain 2-0. The final will take place at Wembley stadium at 3 PM EST. Most thought that Bayern Munchen would go through to the final but Joselu scored in the 88th and 91st minute to secure a spot for Los Blancos in the Final. Most think that Madrid will win their fifteenth Champions League but Dortmund might pull a miracle.\r<br><br>\r<br><br>After the Final:\r<br><br>The final ended 0-2 to Madrid in a pretty dull final. In the first forty-five Dortmund looked like they could pull off the impossible. Niclas Fullkrug hit the post and Karim Adeyemi almost scored too. Many were saying that if Dortmund did not score before the break they would lose the game. Later in the match Madrid scored through a super header from Dani Carvajal, the first Jew to score in the Champions League final. Also Vinicius Jr scored with an assist from Jude Bellingham. The final results were unsurprising. Congratulations to the 2023/2024 Real Madrid for winning the Champions League!\r<br><br>", "author": "Jake Weiss", "src": "sports/imgs/UEFA Champions League Final.jpeg", "date": "2024-06-05 11:57:58.209143"}
