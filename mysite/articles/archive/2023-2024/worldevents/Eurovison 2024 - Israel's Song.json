{"title": "Eurovison 2024 - Israel's Song", "article": "On May 7, 9, and 11 Eurovision 2024 will take place. This year there are 56 competing countries and it will be held in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. \r\n<br><br>Because of the war in Gaza, this year there is a lot of controversy about Israel being in the competition, and some people are pushing for Israel to be banned from the competition altogether. Some reporters on the event are even removing Israel's song from their reports and videos.\r\n<br><br>Israel's song, Hurricane, was actually not Israel's first submission. Eden Golan first won the competition in Israel for her song October Rain, but the Eurovision committee refused it because they thought that it was too political. Eden revised her song and resubmitted it under a new song title.\r\n<br><br>Eurovision World, a website dedicated to the odds of the competition, thinks that Israel will finish 9th with Switzerland finishing 1st.\r\n<br><br>As the competition draws nearer try and listen to some of the songs and decide which one you think is the best. If you are interested you can also watch the competition on Peacock.\r\n<br><br>", "author": "Adam Bellows", "src": "worldevents/imgs/Eurovison 2024 - Israel's Song.jpeg", "date": "2024-04-14 14:33:23.352905"}
