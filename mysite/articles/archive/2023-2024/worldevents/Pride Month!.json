{"title": "Pride Month!", "article": "Pride Month\u2014more commonly known as June\u2014is a celebration of LGBTQIA+ people. LGBTQIA is a shortened version of LGGBDTTTIQQAAPP+, which stands for Lesbian, Gay, Genderqueer, Bisexual, Demisexual, Transgender, Transsexual, Twospirit, Intersex, Queer, Questioning, Asexual, Allies, Pansexual, Polyamorous and more. Usually people express this by wearing the colors of the pride flag which are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and sometimes white, brown, black and pink. Conducting an interview with 14 other children in the Senesh Times, 4 said they do identify with the LGBTQ+ acronym, and 10 said they do not. Pride month is also used to remember the bad things that happened to LGBTQ+ people just because of what they are. One of these famous events is the Stonewall Inn. A six-day battle between LGBTQIA+ people and the police, LGBTQ+ people won and kept the bar. Many people refer to the Stonewall event as a \u201criot\u201d or a series of riots. Many Stonewall residents say they prefer the term \u201cuprising\u201d or \u201crebellion\u201d. (information from guides.loc.gov) Nowadays, people are slowly progressing towards a more equal world for LGBTQ+ people. Sadly, some people still are bullied and cyberbullied for being gay, lesbian or other. Some people aren\u2019t doing things themselves, but are donating to places that do help, such as the Ali Forney Center, The Anti-Violence Project, or the Brooklyn Community Pride Center. \r\n<br><br>Many people have questions about what the letters in the LGGBDTTTIQQAAPP+ acronym mean, so here is a brief summary of what each letter means. \r\n<br><br>L: Lesbian.
