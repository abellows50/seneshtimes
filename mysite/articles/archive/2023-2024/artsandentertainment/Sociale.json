{"title": "Sociale", "article": "There are many great restaurants in the area around school. One of my personal favorites though, is Sociale. They serve Italian food, they have good customer reviews on Google Maps, and they are just a 6 minute walk from school. The distance is not the only great part though. Sociale also has a great cozy atmosphere and the staff is super friendly and kind. Their specials menu is often changing for the better. One of my top picks when I go to Sociale for a main course is their mushroom risotto. Now, mushroom is a very particular taste, so if you do not like mushrooms you probably will not like this dish, but I love it. Another personal favorite appetizer is their Suppl\u00cd al Telefono. It is a dish with risotto, melted cheese, small pieces of beef inside that you can barely taste, and it is all wrapped in a breaded and fried outer shell. When you bite into it, or cut it with a fork, the cheese oozes out and makes it even better than it was. They can do seating indoors, outdoors, parties, family dinners and so much more. Their drinks are also fantastic, with kid options, adult options and non-alcoholic options. They also have a sparkling lemonade that my brother Leo Friedman (3rd) highly enjoys. They also have breakfast which is very good. They have a light, sweet french toast with a delicious mascarpone cream, and they have some Italian pastries including a Cornetto, which is kind of like an italian, flakey croissant. Their desserts are sublime, and they have a variety of options. My favorite is their warm chocolate cake with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream on the side. They also have a tiramisu, which I know some kids love. I love all of their food, so I highly recommend going if you can.
