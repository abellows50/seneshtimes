{"title": "January 2024 - Book Recommendations!", "article": "- <b>Lord of the Rings:</b> Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum.\r\n</br></br>\r\n- <b>One of us is Lying:</b> On Monday afternoon, five students at Bayview High walk into detention.  \r\nOnly, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. Before the end of detention Simon's dead. And according to investigators, his death wasn\u2019t an accident. On Monday, he died. But on Tuesday, he\u2019d planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates, which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Or are they the perfect patsies for a killer who\u2019s still on the loose?\r\n</br></br>\r\n- <b>The Hunger Games:</b> In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by 12 outlying districts. The Capitol keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to death before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Still, if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. \r\n</br></br>\r\n- <b>The Giver:</b> The haunting story centers on twelve-year-old Jonas, who lives in a seemingly ideal, if colorless, world of conformity and contentment. Not until he is given his life assignment as the Receiver of Memory does he begin to understand the dark, complex secrets behind his fragile community. \r\n</br></br>\r\n- <b>Gone:</b> In the blink of an eye, everyone disappears. Gone. Except for the young. There are teens, but not one single adult. Just as suddenly, there are no phones, no Internet, no television. No way to get help. And no way to figure out what's happened. Hunger threatens. Bullies rule. A sinister creature lurks. Animals are mutating. And the teens themselves are changing, developing new talents - unimaginable, dangerous, deadly powers - that grow stronger by the day. It's a terrifying new world. Sides are being chosen, a fight is shaping up. Townies against rich kids. Bullies against the weak. Powerful against powerless. And time is running out: on your birthday, you disappear just like everyone else.", "author": "Adam Bellows and Yardena Stone-Horwitz", "src": "artsandentertainment/imgs/January 2024 - Book Recommendations!.jpeg", "date": "2024-02-01 22:46:05.147374"}
