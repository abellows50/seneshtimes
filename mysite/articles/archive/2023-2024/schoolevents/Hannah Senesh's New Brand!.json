{"title": "Hannah Senesh's New Brand!", "article": "On Friday, Purim was celebrated at Senesh. On Friday, Siobhan Balazs, Hannah Senesh's Director of Marketing and Communications launched Hannah Senesh's new logo! During a Senesh Senate meeting prior to Friday, Siobhan talked about Senesh's reasoning for the change. \"We wanted to shake things up and we thought about the things that made Senesh, Senesh! Our first thought was faith, we are a Jewish school and we are proud of who we are. Secondly, we are a community, it's even in our name!\" Siobhan combined the two ideas together. She took the tablets with the ten commandments and turned them on their side. Next, she aligned them so it looked like two people shaking hands! This magically spelled S for Senesh!\r\n<br><br>We also changed our color scheme. Orange is a hard color to pair with other colors and sometimes it's a little hard to look at. Blue, the main color is a simple and pretty color. We did not completely remove the orange though, one of the main colors in the color scheme is still orange. \"We did not want to divorce ourselves from our past,\" says Siobhan.\r\n<br><br>Also, Siobhan is working on a new Hannah Senesh website, with new features and an entire new color scheme. The website will be released in May, on Yom Ha'atzmaut! Since Siobhan is only one person the change of brand will be slow. You should start seeing changes around the school and the new logo popping up everywhere!", "author": "Adam Bellows", "src": "schoolevents/imgs/Hannah Senesh's New Brand!.jpeg", "date": "2024-03-22 22:08:38.843719"}
