It takes place in Persia where the Jews had to go outside of Israel without a temple. Purim is a festive holiday where you dress up and parade! It\u2019s a day where you can party and have fun. Here at Hannah Senesh, we come dressed up (except for the party poopers) in any costume. We all meet in the gym and sing songs together. During the week of Purim, the teachers teach us about the Purim story. Every year, we review and learn something new about it!", "author": "Noa Kamil", "src": "schoolevents/imgs/Purim.jpeg", "date": "2024-03-08 22:46:05.147374"}
