{"title": "Nex Benidect: Rest in Power", "article": "On February 8th, a 16 year-old transgender person named Nex Benedict was killed in a girls bathroom in Oklahoma. Nex was born on January 11th, 2008, and died February 8th, the day after they were assaulted. In Oklahoma, there are no gender-neutral bathrooms, so Nex went into a girls bathroom where three girls physically bullied Nex. They died the next day. This tragic event shocked people worldwide and influenced many protests and marches against trans hate.\r\n<br><br>We must shed light on this tragedy and prevent more hatred. Possible actions include making signs, and talking to your Senesh Senate representatives about what we can did. Members of the GSA will be making posters and other projects for a middle school announcement. If we stand together, we can\u2019t be put down. Talk with your parents or teachers to raise your awareness and figure out a way for you to help.\r\n<br><br>If you can, work on something for school during the GSA. And one more thing; Rest In Power, Nex Benedict.", "author": "Sam Weiner", "src": "schoolevents/imgs/Nex Benidect: Rest in Power.png", "date": "2024-03-26 14:19:52.601815"}
