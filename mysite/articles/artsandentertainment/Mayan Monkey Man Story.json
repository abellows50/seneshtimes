{"title": "Mayan Money Man Story", "article": "Deep in the jungles of South America a lone explorer named John walked through the jungle. While walking he found another group of explorers. He asked them what they were doing.\r\n<br><br>The leader of the group, Wellson, replied. \u201cWe're looking for the ancient temple of Ka Kua. It's the temple of chocolate.\u201d\r\n<br><br>\u201cWhy in the world would you want to find a temple of chocolate,\u201d said John.\r\n<br><br>\u201cWell . . . legend has it that if you can make it to the center of the temple there's a bar of chocolate that has a taste like nothing else in existence. And it's actually healthy,\u201d Wellson answered. \r\n<br><br>\u201cHow does that help anything if there's only one of them,\u201dJohn fired back.\r\n<br><br>\u201cWell there\u2019s actually infinite,\u201d Wellson responded.\r\n<br><br>\u201cNow that I think about it . . .\u201d said John \u201cI actually saw a temple with chocolate on the ruins not too far from here.\u201d\t\t\t \r\n<br><br>\u201cWait,\u201d said Wellson. \u201cDid the chocolate appear any different from normal?\u201d\r\n<br><br>\u201cActually it appeared to be shooting lightning out of it. It looked pretty legendary to me,\u201d John said.\t \r\n<br><br>\u201cWell let\u2019s head over there,\u201d said Wellson. And thus the explorers walked to the temple which actually turned out to be Ka Kua. As they approached the temple the ground began to shake and crumble. \r\n<br><br>\u201cWoh!!!!\u201d they all screamed. Suddenly a massive brown something leaped out of the ground and landed right in front of them. boom.. Then boom. Again. Two massive ten feet tall chocolate golems stood before them. If looks could kill those golems would have turned the men to dust and iron to liquid. Luckily looks can\u2019t kill. \r\n<br><br>First, one of the explorers attacked one golem by eating it. He ended up getting punched into a tree 30 feet away. Ouch! Next another explorer pulled out a rifle and shot the other golem through the heart. Pow. \r\n<br><br>\u201cYes,\u201d said the explorer. \u201cShot through the heart.\u201d \r\n<br><br>\u201c\ud83c\udfb6And you're to blame\ud83c\udfb6,\u201d called out another explorer in a sing-song voice. Come on, said John as he stabbed one golem through the chest with his machete. \r\n<br><br>\u201cLook,\u201d Wellson cried. The entrance door had opened,  a dark, menacing inside . . . as the group (minus the man in the tree) walked through the temple they discovered a boiling waterfall of chocolate. \u201cWell that\u2019s not something you see every day,\u201d said one of the other explorers. \r\n<br><br>\u201cDuh.\u201d called out another. \r\n<br><br>\u201cLuckily I brought an umbrella in case of rain,\u201dJohn said. He held the umbrella under the waterfall, clearing a path. A loud hissing sound filled the air. The umbrella was melting! \r\n<br><br>\u201cHurry!\u201d Wellson cried out. The men ran in through the opening as fast as possible. John was barely able to jump through the hole before the umbrella was completely covered in boiling chocolate. \r\n<br><br>\u201cThat was a close one,\u201d said a very agitated John. \r\n<br><br>\u201cAlright!\u201d said Wellson. \u201cLet\u2019s keep moving.\u201d\r\n<br><br>\u201cI wish we could,\u201d said an explorer. A massive wall of chocolate stood in front of them blocking the path forward. \r\n<br><br>\u201cSo what do we do,\u201d someone asked. \r\n<br><br>\u201cWe eat,\u201d said another. And they began eating. \r\n<br><br>And that\u2019s how they spent the rest of eternity. Because for every bite you take out of that wall one thousand more pieces appear.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>THE END", "author": "Maxwell Rothberger", "src": "artsandentertainment/imgs/Mayan Monkey Man Story.jpeg", "date": "2024-03-22 21:49:34.103272"}
