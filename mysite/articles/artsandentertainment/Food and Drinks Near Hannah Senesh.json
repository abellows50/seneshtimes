{"title": "Food and Drinks Near Hannah Senesh", "article": "Have you ever been around the school area and seen Delis and restaurants and wondered what to get? I feel the same way! Here is a list of the top 5 items from around the school area in case you need advice on what to eat!\r\n<br><br>1. Nili's Iced Chocolate ($4.00): This iced chocolate is the perfect drink for summer. It's perfectly chocolatey, creamy, and icy.\r\n<br><br>2. Jarritos Grapefruit Soda ($2.25) : This soda offers a fruity and sour flavor, making it suitable on both summer and winter days. I would recommend it for people seeking an affordable and sweet beverage option.\r\n<br><br>3. Cotton Candy ($1.25): This Cotton Candy feels like a circus. It's a very nostalgic taste of going to a street fair and begging your parents to have one more.\r\n<br><br>4. Twin Snakes Haribo ($2.50) These gummies are chewy but also fruity. When you buy them you want to eat them all at the same time because of how tasty they are.\r\n<br><br>5. Nili\u2019s Pita with Hummus and pickles ($8.00) This is a perfect snack to fill you up before a road trip. If you don't like pickles don't put them on. When eating this get it toasted and with tahini.  \r\n<br><br>These are just a few of the many treats and snacks around our neighborhood.
