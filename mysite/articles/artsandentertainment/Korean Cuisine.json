{"title": "Korean Cuisine", "article": "Korean cuisine has been around for over 5000 years. Although way back then, it depended on your rank. If you were a peasant you didn\u2019t get most of the foods you would eat today. For example rice cakes or bibim-bap. Those were considered very luxurious foods in Ancient Korea. Now, in present time rice cakes and bibim-bap aren\u2019t considered luxurious, more like simple and easy to make. Over the years, more \u201cluxurious\u201d foods came in their place, like cold noodles or sinseollo (royal Korean hot pot). Nowadays you can get these foods anywhere.\r\n<br><br>According to wikipedia, \u201cKorean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine reflects a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.\r\n<br><br>Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, seafood and (at least in South Korea) meats. Dairy is largely absent from the traditional Korean diet.\u201d.\r\n<br><br>", "author": "Noa Kamil", "src": "artsandentertainment/imgs/Korean Cuisine.png", "date": "2024-02-01 22:46:05.147374"}
