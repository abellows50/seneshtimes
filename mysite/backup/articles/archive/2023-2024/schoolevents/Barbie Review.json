{"title": "Barbie Review", "article": "Barbie was a big hit in cinema this year, because of the many changes while filming, so cenophiles have been anticipating its release for a long time. and when it came out they were not disappointed so I will be rating everything from casting to costumes in Barbie.\r\n<br><br>Sets: 96% This is one of the first times that they made a movie where it takes place in a cartoon land from a series of toys, and they were amazing with cutting edge modernism while still keeping a authentic toy them\r\n<br><br>Plot: 91% How they manage to tell a story about sexism while telling a story of an unfamiliar place while telling a story of a toy is wonderful. This plot was so good I saw the movie multiple times in theaters because of it.\r\n<br><br>Costume design: 100% Each character, even those with little lines is given a huge personality, and a unique wardrobe to support it.\r\n<br><br>Cast: 98% The roles of Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie were solid but there could have been more characters with more depth and intention.", "author": "Harry Fine", "src": "schoolevents/imgs/Barbie Review.png", "date": "2024-04-14 00:03:41.539581"}
