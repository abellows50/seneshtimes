{"title": "Yom HaShoah", "article": "On Monday, May 6th, Yom Hashoah or Holocaust Remembrance Day, was celebrated. Yom Hashoah is celebrated to remember the Jews and other innocent people that the world lost through WWII. \r<br><br>Yom Hashoah is important because we must celebrate our past, no matter how sad it is to remember. Even if the past is hard or terrifying we must remember it and the many lives that were brutally taken. A quote from Anne Frank is \u201cWhat is done cannot be undone, but one can prevent it happening again.\u201d I feel this quote shows that the holocaust cannot be undone but we can fight it if it happens again. \r<br><br>On this day at Hannah Senesh we remember by having memorial tekes and sharing the stories of our family members.
