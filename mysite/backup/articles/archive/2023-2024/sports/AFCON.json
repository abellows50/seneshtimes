{"title": "AFCON", "article": "The Afcon final 2023 was very surprising and excited . On February 11th 2024 Ivory Coast or Cote D'ivoire in french won the Africa Cup of Nations for the third time. They defeated Nigeria in an astonishing 2-1 win. William Troost- Ekong opened the scoring for the super eagles in the 38th minute.  The Ivorians controlled possession and it looked like they were going to score. After countless amounts of opportunities Franck Kessi\u00e9 netted a beautiful header beyond Stanley Nawabali to equalize for Ivory Coast. Nigeria were not looking like the world class team we know them as, instead they gifted possession to Ivory Coast and sat back and gave the Ivorians many chances. Because of this, the Borussia Dortmund striker Sebastian Haller netted a beautiful strike into the top corner. This was emotional for Haller because about a year prior he overcame testicular cancer. This was an incredible milestone for the Ivorian international. As Ivory Coast lifted the trophy the celebrations started in the capital city of Abidjan.  Ivory Coast struggled in the group stages and luckily made it to the knockout stage. Additionally, they sacked their coach so that was another setback. As an interim coach, Ivory Coast hired Emerse Fae but after they won the tournament the Ivorian football federation hired Emerse Fae as the full time coach. This was one of the most interesting and famous AFCON\u2019s of all time.", "author": "Jake Weiss", "src": "sports/imgs/AFCON.jpeg", "date": "2024-03-08 22:46:05.147374"}
