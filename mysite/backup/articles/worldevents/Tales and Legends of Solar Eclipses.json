{"title": "Tales and Legends of Solar Eclipses", "article": "Throughout history, people all over the world have been experiencing the natural phenomenon of an eclipse. On April 8th, New York City will experience its own partial solar eclipse . Nowadays, we might know that solar eclipses happen when the moon moves between the Earth and Sun, but in history people have believed everything from unhappy gods to a clumsy sun could be the cause of this phenomenon.\r\n<br><br>The Ancient Greeks believed that eclipses were a sign that the Gods were angry and would punish them. They believed that the king would be killed. As a solution, they put a \u201csubstitute king\u201d in their king\u2019s place, for they believed the gods would be tricked into killing him instead of the real king. In Norse mythology, they believed that a giant wolf  was trying to swallow the sun. This is similar to the beliefs in China, Mongolia, and Siberia, where myths included mythical characters swallowing the Sun and/or Moon.  The Native American Chippewa people thought that the sun had gone out,  so they shot flaming arrows into the sky in hopes of rekindling it.", "author": "Ava Samuels", "src": "worldevents/imgs/Tales and Legends of Solar Eclipses.jpeg", "date": "2024-03-22 21:38:21.968614"}
