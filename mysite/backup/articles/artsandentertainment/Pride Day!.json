{"title": "Pride Day!", "article": "On June 5th, the GSA participants will be planning our Hannah Senesh Pride Day! Pride Day is going to celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community. (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual/aromantic/agender, Bisexual, Demisexual, Transgender, Transsexual, Twospirit, Intersex, Questioning, Asexual, Allies, Pansexual, Polyamorous and more.) We (GSA participants) are hoping to put together a pride parade! We\u2019ll sing songs and there might be speakers talking about Pride and performances. \r<br><br>\r<br><br>If anyone was wondering, the GSA stands for the Gender and Sexuality Alliance. It is a place for people to meet, talk about gender, and to hang. It is run by Kate Barton, the middle school counselor and health class teacher, and Joseph Hayden, 8th grade humanities teacher. The GSA is a place for all people to feel safe, and it is a great place to come to show you care. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to come though.\r<br><br>\r<br><br>For those who are reading The Pants Project in 6A, 6th grade (Noa K, Nevo B, and Harry F) we are going to be doing a podcast interviewing Joseph Hayden (humanities teacher) about LGBTQIA+ related things. For those who like these kinds of things, be sure to check it out when we record it!\r<br><br>", "author": "Marshall Friedman, Noa Kamil, Lukas Jones", "src": "artsandentertainment/imgs/Pride Day!.png", "date": "2024-05-15 23:57:42.021780"}
